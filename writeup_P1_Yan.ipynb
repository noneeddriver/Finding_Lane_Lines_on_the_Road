    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipeline consisted of 7 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I use the Canny algorithm to detect edges in grayscaled images. The Gaussian smoothing was then used to smooth the edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I defined a regio of interest (ROI), which was applied as a mask in the image. I detected line segments in edges point images with the Hough tranform, but only in the ROI. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Next were the detected line segments devided to the left group and the right groutp, depending on their solops. Additionally with the X-positon of the line segments were the plausibility also checked. For instance, the right line segments schouldn't have a X-Position smaller than 500. Besides, the slope of each left line segment should be within the reasonable tolerance arround the average slope of left line segments. This can help filter out the disturb and noise, especially for the image solidYellowCurve2.jpg. \n",
    "\n",
    "right line segments before filter:\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "                                   \n",
    "  right line segments after filter:\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "                                   \n",
    "\n",
    "I generate then points with an increment at the detected line segments. For each line segment could their end points be choosed, no matter the length of line segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the generated points would a left line and a right line fitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, the two lines would with the original image merged, with weights. The result looks well. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Other images were also tested, they were all fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential shortcoming would be limited accuracy when the lane line are not so straight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another shortcoming is my pipeline get following error at the video solidWhiteRight (between third and fourth second):\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "\n",
    "I have tried to debug but didn't solve it. Could you please help me with your with your advanced knowledge and experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement would be to fit the points in polynom instead of straight line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential improvement could be to make the video annotation robuster."
